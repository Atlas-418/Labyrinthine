# Labyrinthine

A project made with Bevy, by Atlas-418.

## what even is it?
Labyrinthine is a game made by me (Atlas-418) for the 2024 FBLA (Future Buisness Leaders of America) Game design and simulation challenge. 
## What do I want to do with it? (A TODO list for me)
My goals:
- [ ] Procedural generation of the maze
- [ ] multiple paths, guided by riddles. Each path has it's own moral dilemma for following it
- [ ] figure out how to incorperate said moral dilemmas into the maze, and make it solevable via hints

And now the steps to achive those goals:
- [ ] Learn the Bevy API
- [ ] Get collisions and rendering
- [ ] Get a first person camera working
- [ ] move the first person camera around
- [ ] Figure out how to proceduraly generate a maze
- [ ] Apply the procedural maze

Things we need to make it through reigionals:
- [ ] Ability to move
- [ ] Moral dilemmas with multiple outcomes
- [ ] Allow the user to choose between the outcomes somehow
- [ ] Accessability options
- [ ] Title screen

And some random ideas I could implement:
* Randomized colour pallete (use OKlab to generate?)
