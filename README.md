# Labyrinthine

A project made with Bevy, by Atlas-418.

## what even is it?
Labyrinthine is a game made by me (Atlas-418) for the 2024 FBLA (Future Buisness Leaders of America) Game design and simulation challenge. 
## What do I want to do with it? (A TODO list for me)
My goals:
- [ ] Procedural generation of the maze
- [ ] multiple paths, guided by riddles. Each path has it's own moral dilemma for following it
- [ ] figure out how to incorperate said moral dilemmas into the maze, and make it solevable via hints
